What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n"," - A function is a block of reusable code that can be called by its name, and it is not tied to any specific object. You define it using the def keyword\n"," - A method is similar to a function, but it is associated with an object and is called on that object. Methods are functions that belong to a class\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n"," - Parameters are placeholders in the function definition. They define what kind of input the function expects.\n"," - Arguments are the actual values you pass to the function when calling it.\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n"," Defining a function:\n"," - def greet(name):\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n"," Calling a function:\n"," - print(greet(\"Steve\"))\n"," Using a lambda function:\n"," - greet = lambda name: f\"Hello, {name}\"\n","print(greet(\"Steve\"))\n","4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n"," - The return statement sends a value back to the caller of the function. It ends the function's execution and provides the result.\n"," Example:\n"," - def add(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","result = add(3, 4)\n","print(result)\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n"," - A set is used instead of a list when you need to remove duplicate values automatically.\n","6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n"," - A string is a sequence of characters (immutable) in Python.\n","A list is a mutable sequence that can contain elements of different data types.\n","Strings are typically used for textual data, whereas lists are used for collections of items.\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n"," - Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This ensures that:\n","    Data remains consistent and protected from accidental modification.\n","    They can be used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets, unlike lists.\n","8. 4. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n"," - A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hashing function to compute an index. Python dictionaries use hash tables internally to provide:\n","    Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions (average time complexity ùëÇ(1)).\n","    Keys must be hashable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n"," - Yes, Python lists can contain elements of different data types.\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n"," - Strings are immutable because:\n","    It ensures thread safety during concurrent operations.\n","    It allows string objects to be interned or reused, saving memory and improving performance.\n","    Modifying a string requires creating a new one, preventing accidental changes.\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n"," - Dictionaries are preferred when:\n","    Data needs to be accessed by keys rather than index positions.\n","    The order of elements isn‚Äôt crucial.\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n"," - If we want to store the marks of the students then using tuple is more effective as it avoid data manipulation.\n","13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n"," - Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. If you add a duplicate value to a set, it will be ignored.\n","  s = {1, 2, 3, 3}\n","  print(s)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n","14. For lists, in checks for the presence of a value.\n","    For dictionaries, in checks for the presence of a value, not the key.\n","      l = [1, 2, 3]\n","      print(1 in l)  # True\n","\n","      d = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n","      print(\"a\" in d)  # True\n","      print(1 in d)    # False\n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n"," - No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. However, if the tuple contains mutable objects (e.g., a list), the mutable object itself can be modified.\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n"," - A nested dictionary is a dictionary where values are dictionaries themselves.\n","    students = {\n","    \"Alice\": {\"math\": 90, \"science\": 85},\n","    \"Bob\": {\"math\": 78, \"science\": 92}\n","        }\n","    print(students[\"Alice\"][\"math\"])  # Output: 90\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n"," - Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of ùëÇ(1) due to the underlying hash table.\n","18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n"," - Lists are preferred when:\n","    Data does not require a key-value structure.\n","    The order of elements is important.\n","    You need to perform sequential operations like slicing or sorting.\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n"," - Before Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered, meaning their elements had no guaranteed sequence. In Python older versions, dictionaries preserve insertion order, but retrieval is still based on keys, not positions.\n","20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n"," - Lists: Retrieve elements by index position.\n","    l = [10, 20, 30]\n","    print(l[1])  # Output: 20\n"," - Dictionaries: Retrieve elements by key.\n","    d = {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 20}\n","    print(d[\"b\"])  # Output: 20\n","1.
